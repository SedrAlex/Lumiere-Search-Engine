# TF-IDF Evaluation Issues and Fixes

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. Model Loading Problem
- **Issue**: TF-IDF vectorizer can't be loaded due to missing `EnhancedTokenizer` reference
- **Root Cause**: Vectorizer was trained with custom tokenizer that's not available at load time
- **Error**: `Can't get attribute 'EnhancedTokenizer'`

### 2. Evaluation Approach Issues
- **Issue**: Previous evaluation may not be using ANTIQUE qrels correctly
- **Problems**:
  - Unclear if queries should be cleaned before evaluation
  - Need to verify MAP calculation is correct
  - Need to ensure proper use of ANTIQUE test split and qrels

## 📊 ANTIQUE Dataset Analysis Results

### Qrels Structure (CORRECT FORMAT):
- **Total qrels**: 6,589 relevance judgments
- **Unique queries**: 200 (all have judgments)
- **Relevance levels**: 1, 2, 3, 4 (ALL > 0 are relevant)
- **Average judgments per query**: 32.9

### Query Format:
- **Natural language questions** (e.g., "how can we get concentration onsomething?")
- **Average length**: 9.3 words
- **Should test both cleaned and raw processing**

## ✅ Recommended Fixes

### 1. Fix Model Loading
```python
# Option A: Retrain models with proper tokenizer handling
# Option B: Load models with correct tokenizer context
# Option C: Use pre-trained models that don't have tokenizer dependencies
```

### 2. Proper Evaluation Approach
```python
# Use ANTIQUE test queries (not cleaned beforehand)
queries = load_antique_test_queries()  # Original text

# Use ANTIQUE qrels (relevance > 0 = relevant)
qrels = load_antique_qrels()

# Test BOTH approaches:
results_with_cleaning = evaluate_queries(queries, use_cleaning=True)
results_without_cleaning = evaluate_queries(queries, use_cleaning=False)

# Calculate MAP correctly:
# AP = (1/R) * Σ(P(k) * rel(k))
# MAP = mean(AP) across all queries
```

### 3. Evaluation Metrics to Calculate
- **MAP** (Mean Average Precision) - Primary metric
- **MRR** (Mean Reciprocal Rank)
- **P@1, P@5, P@10, P@20** (Precision at K)
- **R@1, R@5, R@10, R@20** (Recall at K)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Fix Model Loading**:
   - Either retrain models with proper tokenizer serialization
   - Or load existing models with correct context

2. **Run Proper Evaluation**:
   - Use `proper_antique_evaluation.py` script
   - Test both cleaned and raw query processing
   - Compare results to see if cleaning helps

3. **Validate Results**:
   - Compare with published ANTIQUE baseline results
   - Ensure MAP calculation is correct
   - Document which approach (cleaned vs raw) performs better

## 💡 Key Insights

- **All ANTIQUE relevance levels (1,2,3,4) are considered relevant**
- **Should test both cleaned and raw query processing**
- **MAP calculation must be done correctly per the formula**
- **Need to fix model loading issue first before evaluation**

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

After fixes:
- TF-IDF models should load properly
- Evaluation should show clear MAP, MRR, P@K, R@K metrics
- We'll know if query cleaning improves or hurts performance
- Results should be comparable to published ANTIQUE baselines
