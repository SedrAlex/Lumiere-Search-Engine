# Embedding MAP Analysis: Why You're Getting 0.14 Instead of 0.4+

## Current Situation
- **Your embedding MAP**: 0.14 (14%)
- **Your TF-IDF MAP**: 0.174 (17.4%) 
- **Expected embedding MAP**: 0.25-0.35 (25-35%)
- **Problem**: Embeddings are underperforming TF-IDF significantly

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Model Choice Issue (Most Likely Cause)**
Your current model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is a lightweight model that may not capture semantic relationships well enough for the Antique dataset.

**Evidence:**
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is optimized for speed, not quality
- Antique dataset requires understanding complex question-answer relationships
- Better models typically show 20-40% improvement

**Solution:**
```python
# Replace in your training script:
model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')  # Instead of all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

### 2. **Preprocessing Inconsistency (Confirmed Issue)**
Your evaluation was using different preprocessing for queries vs documents:
- **Documents**: `remove_stopwords=True`
- **Queries**: `remove_stopwords=False` (in original evaluation)

**Impact**: This mismatch can reduce MAP by 20-30%

**Solution**: Use identical preprocessing for both (already fixed in corrected script)

### 3. **Domain Mismatch (Likely Issue)**
Pre-trained embeddings may not understand domain-specific language in Antique dataset.

**Evidence:**
- Antique contains technical questions (chemistry, physics, etc.)
- Pre-trained models are general-purpose
- TF-IDF captures exact term matches better for technical content

**Solutions:**
- Fine-tune the model on Antique training data
- Use domain-specific embedding models
- Hybrid approach (TF-IDF + embeddings)

### 4. **Evaluation Methodology Issues (Possible)**
- Document ID mismatches between training and evaluation
- Incorrect relevance judgment alignment
- Using wrong similarity metric

### 5. **Training Data Issues (Less Likely)**
- Incomplete document processing
- Embeddings not normalized properly
- Matrix alignment problems

## Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Try Better Model (Highest Impact)
```bash
# Run this to test all-mpnet-base-v2
python quick_fix_better_model.py
```
**Expected improvement**: MAP from 0.14 â†’ 0.18-0.22

### Step 2: Verify File Locations
Make sure you have these files in your backend directory:
- `antique_embeddings_matrix.joblib`
- `antique_embedding_document_metadata.joblib`

If missing, re-run your training script or copy from where they were generated.

### Step 3: Run Diagnostics
```bash
python embedding_diagnostic.py
```

### Step 4: Consider Hybrid Approach
If embeddings still underperform, combine with your working TF-IDF:
```python
# Hybrid scoring
final_score = 0.6 * tfidf_score + 0.4 * embedding_score
```

## Expected Results by Approach

| Approach | Expected MAP | Effort | Confidence |
|----------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Better model (mpnet) | 0.18-0.22 | Low | High |
| Fine-tuning | 0.22-0.28 | High | Medium |
| Hybrid TF-IDF+Embeddings | 0.20-0.25 | Medium | High |
| Query expansion | 0.16-0.20 | Medium | Medium |

## Why Your TF-IDF Outperforms

Your TF-IDF system (MAP=0.174) outperforms embeddings because:

1. **Exact term matching**: TF-IDF finds documents with exact query terms
2. **Domain vocabulary**: Captures technical terms better
3. **Tuned preprocessing**: Your preprocessing works well for TF-IDF
4. **No semantic confusion**: Doesn't get confused by semantic similarity

## Next Steps Priority

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Test all-mpnet-base-v2 model
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Implement hybrid approach
3. **LOW PRIORITY**: Fine-tune model (if you have GPU resources)

## Code Examples

### Quick Test with Better Model
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Load better model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')

# Re-generate embeddings with same cleaned texts
# Then re-evaluate
```

### Hybrid Approach
```python
def hybrid_search(query, tfidf_scores, embedding_scores, alpha=0.6):
    """Combine TF-IDF and embedding scores"""
    # Normalize scores to [0,1]
    tfidf_norm = tfidf_scores / tfidf_scores.max()
    embedding_norm = embedding_scores / embedding_scores.max()
    
    # Weighted combination
    hybrid_scores = alpha * tfidf_norm + (1-alpha) * embedding_norm
    return hybrid_scores
```

The most likely fix is switching to `all-mpnet-base-v2` - this alone could bring your MAP from 0.14 to 0.18-0.22, making it competitive with your TF-IDF system.
